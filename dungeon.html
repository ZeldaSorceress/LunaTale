            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Proceed to where the red arrow is pointing. There is a chest with 20G along with a save point.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong> The object circled will give you restorative items. The enemy in the red square is the miniboss, you will have to fight him and his brother to proceed. After completing that, you may proceed to the place marked with the red arrow. In the last room you have to fight the boss and his minions. Before entering this room make sure you are well prepared as you cannot go back. The only way to return is to defeat the boss. Once you have defeated the boss he will drop the Blessing of Life(main collectable) and afterwards you will be safely teleported outside of the dungeon. You will then proceed to the next area.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The temple was originally guarded by the God of Life, but after a terrible war with the Wolf demon tribe the God of Life lost the temple. The God of Life struck a bargain with the leader of the Wolf demon tribe. He offered them the temple if they guarded the Blessing of Life and left the villagers alone. The leader grumbled about the offer but very quickly agreed to it. The villagers don't go into the temple because anyone who goes in there doesn't come out alive.</p>

When the harpies are defeated, one of them will tell you the secret code to receive the dungeon's special skill. Once you have completed the puzzle you will then be able to get the skill. After you have received the special skill, you will then be able to take on the boss. Upon defeating the boss you will receive the Blessing of Death(Main Collectable).</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong> This cave used to belong to the Goddess of Death, but because she became corrupted she lost it. She is made into the source of the corruption that plauges the land. Seeing this oppurtunity, the Harpy King decided to claim the cave as his own property. Since he has claimed it as his own personal kingdom, none are welcome. The only way to even reach the passage way into the cave is to present an Ancient Shard to the statue in the graveyard. This graveyard can be found in Weeping Village in the top left.</p>

These levers can be found by going down the stairs in the starting room. Each of those stairways leads you to the levers, no fighting is allowed below the stairs so don't worry. Once you have activated both levers, you should be able to pass through the door with the brown curtain. Be aware that danger lies behind this door so go in prepared.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The Goddess of Nature resides inside this dungeon she calls home. She waits for the person to come and be her champion, hence the name "Champion Temple" each God has their own Temple and they are sworn to defend it. There is a lady in the area called Sky City which is located just outside of this Temple. This lady is the daughter of the Goddess of Nature and is entrusted with the Temple key. In order to get inside the Temple, you must get the key from her.</p>

The companion you get before entering this area will come in handy, however he is not that powerful so these battles will prove difficult.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The Goddess of Power is supposed to protect this place but instead she leaves that job to the Dragon who dwells inside.
