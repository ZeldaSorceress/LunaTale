            <h2>Forest Temple</h2>
            <img src="RES/Dungeon Images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 203643.png" alt="image">
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Proceed to where the red arrow is pointing. There is a chest with 20G along with a save point.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong> The object circled will give you restorative items. The enemy in the red square is the miniboss, you will have to fight him and his brother to proceed. After completing that, you may proceed to the place marked with the red arrow. In the last room you have to fight the boss and his minions. Before entering this room make sure you are well prepared as you cannot go back. The only way to return is to defeat the boss. Once you have defeated the boss he will drop the Blessing of Life(main collectable) and afterwards you will be safely teleported outside of the dungeon. You will then proceed to the next area.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The temple was originally guarded by the God of Life, but after a terrible war with the Wolf demon tribe the God of Life lost the temple. The God of Life struck a bargain with the leader of the Wolf demon tribe. He offered them the temple if they guarded the Blessing of Life and left the villagers alone. The leader grumbled about the offer but very quickly agreed to it. The villagers don't go into the temple because anyone who goes in there doesn't come out alive.</p>

            <h2>Weeping Cave</h2>
            <img src="RES/Dungeon Images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 203330.png" alt="image">
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Upon entering this room you will see a savepoint and 2 passages. The top passage will lead you to the boss door and some treasure. The other passage will lead you to receive the boss key.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong>You will receive the boss key by defeating the miniboss which is 2 harpies. When the harpies are defeated, one of them will tell you the secret code to receive the dungeon's special skill. Once you have completed the puzzle you will then be able to get the skill. After you have received the special skill, you will then be able to take on the boss. Upon defeating the boss you will receive the Blessing of Death(Main Collectable).</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong> This cave used to belong to the Goddess of Death, but because she became corrupted she lost it. She is made into the source of the corruption that plauges the land. Seeing this oppurtunity, the Harpy King decided to claim the cave as his own property. Since he has claimed it as his own personal kingdom, none are welcome. The only way to even reach the passage way into the cave is to present an Ancient Shard to the statue in the graveyard. This graveyard can be found in Weeping Village in the top left.</p>

            <h2>Champion Temple</h2>
            <img src="RES/Dungeon Images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 203041.png" alt="image">
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Upon entering you will see 4 passages, but for this part of the game you will not be able to complete the room with the red curtain.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong>You will need to find the levers to proceed to the Boss Room. These levers can be found by going down the stairs in the starting room. Each of those stairways leads you to the levers, no fighting is allowed below the stairs so don't worry. Once you have activated both levers, you should be able to pass through the door with the brown curtain. Be aware that danger lies behind this door so go in prepared.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The Goddess of Nature resides inside this dungeon she calls home. She waits for the person to come and be her champion, hence the name "Champion Temple" each God has their own Temple and they are sworn to defend it. There is a lady in the area called Sky City which is located just outside of this Temple. This lady is the daughter of the Goddess of Nature and is entrusted with the Temple key. In order to get inside the Temple, you must get the key from her.</p>

            <h2>Golum Cave</h2>
            <img src="RES/Dungeon Images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 204939.png" alt="image">
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Upon entering you will see 2 passages you can go through. You will also see a savepoint towards the right. The upper passage will lead you to the boss door and the passage on the left will take you further into the dungeon.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong>You will need to activate the bridge in order to face the miniboss and get the Boss Key. You will have to battle some enemies along the way and it will be difficult because these enemies are immune to almost any type of magic except for Dark magic. The companion you get before entering this area will come in handy, however he is not that powerful so these battles will prove difficult.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The Goddess of Power is supposed to protect this place but instead she leaves that job to the Dragon who dwells inside. It is rumored to believe that the Dragon who currently dwells inside the Cave actually made it himself. The Goddess of Power hasn't been seen for ages but some say she still hides in plain sight waiting for someone worthy of her to appear.</p>
