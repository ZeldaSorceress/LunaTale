            <h2>Forest Temple</h2>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Proceed to where the red arrow is pointing. There is a chest with 20G along with a save point.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong> The object circled will give you restorative items. The enemy in the red square is the miniboss, you will have to fight him and his brother to proceed. After completing that, you may proceed to the place marked with the red arrow. In the last room you have to fight the boss and his minions. Before entering this room make sure you are well prepared as you cannot go back. The only way to return is to defeat the boss. Once you have defeated the boss he will drop the Blessing of Life(main collectable) and afterwards you will be safely teleported outside of the dungeon. You will then proceed to the next area.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong>The temple was originally guarded by the God of Life, but after a terrible war with the Wolf demon tribe the God of Life lost the temple. The God of Life struck a bargain with the leader of the Wolf demon tribe. He offered them the temple if they guarded the Blessing of Life and left the villagers alone. The leader grumbled about the offer but very quickly agreed to it. The villagers don't go into the temple because anyone who goes in there doesn't come out alive.</p>

            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the first room(right image): </strong>Upon entering this room you will see a savepoint and 2 passages. The top passage will lead you to the boss door and some treasure. The other passage will lead you to receive the boss key.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>For the last rooms: </strong>You will receive the boss key by defeating the miniboss which is 2 harpies. When the harpies are defeated, one of them will tell you the secret code to receive the dungeon's special skill. Once you have completed the puzzle you will then be able to get the skill. After you have received the special skill, you will then be able to take on the boss. Upon defeating the boss you will receive the Blessing of Death(Main Collectable).</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Dungeon Lore: </strong> This cave used to belong to the Goddess of Death, but because she became corrupted she lost it. She is made into the source of the corruption that plauges the land. Seeing this oppurtunity, the Harpy King decided to claim the cave as his own property. Since he has claimed it as his own personal kingdom, none are welcome. The only way to even reach the passage way into the cave is to present an Ancient Shard to the statue in the graveyard. This graveyard can be found in Weeping Village in the top left.</p>
